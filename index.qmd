## Bio
Hi, I'm Tim!

## Projects
Along with my friend [Alexis Ralli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=fe6ZetoAAAAJ), we have developed an open-source python package called [`Symmer`](https://github.com/UCL-CCS/symmer) that allows people to study quantum problems using subspace methods. We welcome users to try it out!  This project has been supported by a grant from the [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/)

## Background
I completed a quantum chemistry PhD in the [Centre for Computational Science group (CCS)](https://ccs.chem.ucl.ac.uk/) group at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).
